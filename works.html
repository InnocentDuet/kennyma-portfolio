    <h2>Works</h2>

    <h3>BCIT Graphic Design Foundation Collection</h3>
    <p>These are a few of the best works that I have done so far during my time as a graphic design student at BCIT.</p>

    <h3>BCITEA Collection</h3>
    <p>As a way to gain more graphic design experience aside from my program, Kenny is taking on a graphic design
        position as an executive for the BCIT Esports Association. There are both <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C10R-JXvuaj/" target="_blank">small</a> and large projects done for
        the club.</p>

    <h3>Personal Collection</h3>
