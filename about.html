    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Originally pursuing to be in the architecture field, Kenny decided to change his path to Graphic Design after
        recieving his undergraduate diploma at BCIT in 2023 of May. He is currently taking Graphic Design at BCIT,
        part-time, while working as an graphic design executive for <a href="#BCITEA">BCIT Esports Association</a> </p>

    <p>Kenny was born in raised in Vancouver, BC with both of his parents and two older brothers. As being a first
        generation Chinese-Canadian, Kenny found comfort being around other students with similar backgrounds and
        interests. During in elementary school, he found interest in animated shows, such as Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and
        Beyblade, to name a few. Although Kenny was academically cruising through his school years, he was always a
        visual learner
        and loved to draw during class. His peers and teachers began to discover that he had a talent at drawing which
        helped boost his confidence. At the beginning of high school, Kenny was introduced to a popular computer game by
        his classmates, called League of Legends. Not only was the game extremely fun to play, the art for every aspect
        of the gaming experience was intruging. That was also when Kenny began to take art more seriously and believe
        that this is the path he was meant to take. </p>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <p>After graduating secondary school at Britannia Secondary school with multiple scholarships and awards, Kenny was
        fortunately chosen to be part of the Architectural and Building Technology Diploma program at BCIT. Eventually
        recieving
        his diploma after two years, he spent his summer break deciding what was next in his career as a young adult. It
        was then decided that architecture was not something Kenny would be for him, as it not reflected with his style
        of interest as when he was in elementary and high school. During the end of the summer term of 2023, Kenny
        finalized his thoughts and decided to take on the path of being a graphic designer. Through seeing many videos
        of the behind-the-scenes for the game that he loved, League of Legends, was when he realized that this was a
        more suitable career path.</p>

    <h3><a name="BCITEA">BCITEA:</a></h3>
    <p>As Kenny began taking his first term as a graphic design student at BCIT, he found an opportunity from one of
        BCIT Student Associations, the Esports club. So far, Kenny currently has the main role of designing
        digital/physical posters, and the yearly club hoodie. Not only does he get to use the knowledge he learned as a
        graphic design student, but he is taking this opportunity to gain experience of what it's like to be in a work-related
        environment as a graphic designer.</p>
